# LCM_reduce.py

Hello everyone! This project is made up of small code! The task of these codes is simply to find the 'LCM', the lowest common multiple of all the values ​​in the array, using the 'numpy' libraries! How will it be? First you enter a number, then a number will be selected by the 'random' function starting from the number 2 up to the number you entered! Then you enter a number again, now when it is 'randomized' up to the number you entered, the 'arange' function is used starting from the selected number, and the value appears in the list. And the last job is the lowest total value of the numbers in this list!


This is how the answer comes out 👇👇👇
